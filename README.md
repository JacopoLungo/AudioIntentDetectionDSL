# AudioIntentDetectionDSL
This repo contains an evaluated project carried out during the Data Science Lab course at Polito.

## Assigment
The assignment is to build a classification pipeline to predict the intent expressed in each audio recording in the dataset. More specifically, given an input audio sample, the goal is to predict both the *action* requested and the *object* affected by the action.
